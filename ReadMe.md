### What I learned


While working on the project using TailwindCss, I learnt how to write reusuable Css codes.

```css
.btn {
    @apply shadow-md py-3 px-6 rounded-md transition duration-300;
}

.btn-purple {
    @apply bg-bookmark-purple text-white;
}

.btn-white {
    @apply bg-bookmark-white
}
```


### Continued development

I will be focusing more on how to make the web page more interactive using Javascript.
